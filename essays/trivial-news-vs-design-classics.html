	<h1>Trivial News <span class="flourish">vs.</span> Design Classics</h1>
	<p class="opening-remarks">This essay was published 27 April, 2014 from Austin, Texas, USA.</p>
	<p>The design community is groaning under the weight of too much news. Every few seconds another <em>indispensable</em> trinket is released and forgotten. In our zeal to keep up with our craft, we take in truckloads of worthless information. If you let them, these trivialities will consume your entire time. And you won’t get any better at your work.</p>
	<p>New is seductive, but classics are classics for a reason. How many of the last fifty articles you’ve read on the latest fad publishing platform can your remember? By contrast, <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> is still relevant over twenty years later. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> could transform your practice, whereas upgrading to the latest CSS framework will accomplish close to nothing.</p>
	<p>Certainly you should have a grasp of what’s happening in your industry. <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, for example, is a great new tool. You should absolutely check it out if you haven’t already. But you don’t have to refresh your favorite nonsense aggregator every few seconds to hear about real innovation. Genuine game-changers will find you.</p>
	<p>Anytime you feel the compulsive need to find out what’s new, dust off one of the classic tomes of design knowledge instead.</p>
	<p>You know you should. ◼︎</p>
